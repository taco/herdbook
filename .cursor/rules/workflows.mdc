# Development Workflows

## Git & Version Control
- **Conventional Commits**: Use conventional commits for all messages.
  - `feat: ...` for new features
  - `fix: ...` for bug fixes
  - `refactor: ...` for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  - `chore: ...` for maintenance (dependencies, config)
- **Pull Requests**: "One conceptual change per PR." Do not mix refactoring with new feature work.

## Data Management
- **Local Data**: Local development data should be persistent. Use manual reset scripts when a clean slate is needed.

## New Feature Protocol
1. **Define Schema**: Start with `schema.prisma` and `schema.graphql`.
2. **Backend Logic**: Implement resolvers/services.
3. **Frontend Integration**: Build UI and connect.
4. **Smoke Test**: Manual verification of the happy path.
