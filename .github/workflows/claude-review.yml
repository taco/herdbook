            Review this PR. CLAUDE.md has the project conventions — use them.

            Focus on (in priority order):
            1. Bugs and logic errors
            2. Security:
               - Missing auth checks (context.rider), data ownership leaks
               - Secrets or credentials in committed code
               - Raw SQL ($queryRaw/$executeRaw) without parameterization
               - Unbounded GraphQL inputs (missing pagination limits, deep nesting)
            3. Suspicious dependency additions in package.json
            4. N+1 queries in nested GraphQL resolvers
            5. schema.prisma ↔ schema.graphql out of sync

            Skip:
            - Formatting, style, and type hygiene (CI and linters handle that)
            - Trivial nitpicks
            - Suggestions that add complexity without clear value

            Be direct. Only comment when something should change.
