Plan:
- Warm up with lots of transitions within the gait.
- Work on counter-canter loops.
- Practice simple changes through the walk.

Execution:
- The counter-canter to the left is getting stronger.
- Right rein contact felt a bit heavy today; spent extra time suppling the right side.
- Simple changes were clean and direct.

Plan for next time:
- More serpentines to encourage even bend on both sides."

Course:
- Set up a 9-fence track including a double and a liverpool.
- Height approx 1.00m - 1.05m.

Performance:
- Warm-up over cross rails and verticals went smoothly.
- First round was a bit rushing; rider needs to sit up more before the fences.
- Second round was excellent – rhythm was consistent and distances came up easily.
- Horse did not look at the liverpool at all. Great confidence booster."

Equipment:

Movements:
- Shoulder-in.
- Haunches-in (Travers).
- Leg yield.

Feedback:
- Shoulder-in is becoming very established at the trot.
- Haunches-in is still a work in progress; horse tends to lose rhythm.
- Leg yield was excellent from center line to wall.
- Rider needs to be careful not to over-bend the neck."
